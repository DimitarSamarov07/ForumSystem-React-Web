# ForumSystem-Angular-Web

My own project *[ForumSystem](https://github.com/DimitarSamarov07/ForumSystem-Web)* rewritten with React. That's my
project assignment for the React course at SoftUni.

## :pencil: Project Description

This is a quick re-write of my old project. It's a fairly simple forum system with an admin panel, separate from the
publicly accessible pages. The project has 2 layouts - one for the public area and another one for everything related to
the admin panel.

## How to run the project locally

Running the project is very simple. Open a new terminal, copy the commands below, and you should be good to go.

```
git clone "https://github.com/DimitarSamarov07/ForumSystem-React-Web"
```

```
cd ForumSystem-React-Web/forum-system
```

```
npm start
```

Don't forget to modify the .env file with your own Backendless credentials and populate the database as shown in the
Database schema below. Feel free to open an issue if you encounter something unexpected.

Enjoy :sparkles:
